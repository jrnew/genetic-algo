\section{Introduction}
A genetic algorithm has the following steps: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Calculate fitness of chromosomes.
	\item Select chromosomes to form a mating pool based on their fitness.
	\item Recombine parent chromosomes from the mating pool.
	\item Apply mutation to produce the resulting generation of chromosomes.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Code}
We took the S3 approach to object-oriented programming for our package and created functions that were as modular as possible to facilitate code creation, maintenance and testing.

For a given data set, e.g. the built-in \texttt{airquality} data set in \texttt{R}, the user can carry out model selection based on the Akaike Information Criterion for an ordinary linear regression of the variable \texttt{Ozone} on other variables in the data set with the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
ga <- select_model(data = airquality, yvar = "Ozone")
\end{verbatim}

Finer control of other parameters in the genetic algorithm 
\begin{verbatim}
ga <- select_model(data = airquality, yvar = "Ozone", xvars = NULL,
	model = "lm", glm_family = NULL, criterion = "AIC",
	pop_size = 100, method_select = "rank",
	method_recombine = "onepoint", prob_recombine = 0.6,
	prob_mutate = 0.01, num_max_iterations = 100,
	seed = 123, do_parallel = FALSE)
\end{verbatim}

The output of the results can be viewed using the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
summary(ga)
model(ga)
\end{verbatim}

The result of this function is an object of \texttt{ga} class that contains the settings, model data, final population of chromosomes/models, model evaluation values of this population and results of model selection using the genetic algorithm.
